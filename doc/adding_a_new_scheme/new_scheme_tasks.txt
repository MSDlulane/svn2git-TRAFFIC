To the PM/Scrum-master:
-----------------------
The numbered points below can be used as a template for creting JIRA tasks for a new scheme/take-on

INDEX:
------
1. GAME Database Configurations
	a. SCHEME_INFO
	b. SCHEME_XREF
	
2. Traffic Server Configurations:
	a. DHS
	b. MHG
	
3. Add the new scheme datasource to SEE and JBoss

4. Create a new persistence unit for BABYLON (JBoss Entity layer)

5. Add the standin-traffic, standin-sweeper configurations


Instructions:
-------------

In all cases, the service the services whose configuration is being altered needs to be restarted.
For SVN permission issues contact jmeyer
This document is versioned so YOU (stop looking around) can make it better. Feel free to add your comments etc.

1.a,b GAME Database Configurations
	//Example for Dev
	//Using Aqua Data Studio connect to CPTLSYB82:7550 SYBASE ASE Database
	//Using the scripts "randwater_scheme_info.sql" and "protekta_example_new_scheme_game_inserts.sql"
	//the scripts are in the same directory as this file.
	//create scripts for adding the 3 SCHEME_XREF entries and the 1 SCHEME_INFO entries

2.a Traffic Server Configurations: Mhg
	Define "env" elements for the scheme in the "DHS" traffic server config.
		//Example for DEV
		svn co https://cptlsvn01/repos/TRAFFIC
		cd TRAFFIC/conf/cptlagw80.za.mhgad.com/DHS
		vim config.xml
		//duplicate the an existing "env" element
		//change the new "env" element to the name and mhgAccount you need 
		//(using different values for these is possible but is not advised).
		//for the cobol "pool" element change the DEV port to the port 
		//obtained from the LINUX IT-Infrastructure team (contact djason/afranks/rknoesen) 
		//allocated to the new scheme. The host will remain cptlapp80 which is DEV COBOL.
		//save the file
		cd ../../../..
		cd TRAFFIC/conf
		vim cobol_app_server_list.txt
		//add the app server port to the development group:
		//Note the fields are a single space separated
		//DEVELOPMENT <SCHEME/ACCOUNT NAME> cptlapp80.za.mhgad.com <SCHEME/ACCOUNT PORT>
		//duplicate a "destination-x-ref" element and add entries for the new XREF entries created in
		//[1.a,b] (the P-code, scheme-code and scheme-name entries in the SCHEME_XREF table of the GAME 
		//database)
		//save the file
		//commit configuration changes
		cd ../
		svn ci -m "Added scheme <SCHEME NAME> to Mhg Traffic"
	
2.b Traffic Server Configurations: Mhg
	Define "env" elements for the scheme in the "Mhg" traffic server config.
		//Example for DEV
		svn co https://cptlsvn01/repos/TRAFFIC
		cd TRAFFIC/conf/cptlagw80.za.mhgad.com/Mhg
		vim config.xml
		//duplicate the AMED "env" element
		//change the new "env" element to the name and mhgAccount you need 
		//(using different values for these is possible but is not advised).
		//for the cobol "pool" element change the DEV port to the port 
		//obtained from the LINUX IT-Infrastructure team (contact djason/afranks/rknoesen) 
		//allocated to the new scheme. The host will remain cptlapp80 which is DEV COBOL.
		//save the file
		cd ../../../..
		cd TRAFFIC/conf
		vim cobol_app_server_list.txt
		//add the app server port to the development group:
		//Note the fields are a single space separated
		//DEVELOPMENT <SCHEME/ACCOUNT NAME> cptlapp80.za.mhgad.com <SCHEME/ACCOUNT PORT>
		//contact EBM and obtain DHS destination codes for the new scheme (kbengu@mhg.co.za)
		//duplicate a "destination-x-ref" element and add entries for the destination codes from DHS
		//save the file
		//commit configuration changes
		cd ../
		svn ci -m "Added scheme <SCHEME NAME> to Mhg Traffic"

3. Add the new scheme datasource to SEE and JBoss
		SEE:
		//NB. production changes need to be made on cptlsee01, cptlsee02, cptlsee03
		//DEV example:
		//ssh to cptlagw80
		vim /opt/mhg/SEE/etc/config.xml
		//duplicate a datasource element change the
		//on the duplicated element:
		//database-name to the scheme database name
		JBoss:
		vim /var/lib/jbossas/server/production/deploy/babylon-cptlsyb80-7550-ds.xml
		//duplicate a "local-tx-datasource" element
		//change the jndi name so that it looks like "jdbc/babylon/<New Scheme Name all lowercase>"
		//change the database name in the database url
		
4. Create a new persistence unit for BABYLON (JBoss Entity layer)
		//DEV Example:
		svn co https://cptlsvn01/repos/babylon/
		cd babylon/branches/development_branch/babylon/src/META-INF/
		vim persistence.xml
		//duplicate an "persistence-unit" element
		//alter the "name" property to "jdbc/babylon2/<New Scheme Name all lowercase>"
		//alter the value of the "persistence-unit" child-element "java:jdbc/babylon/<New Scheme Name all lowercase>" 
		//it must match the datasource-name created in 3:JBoss above

5. Add the standin-traffic, standin-sweeper configurations
		//Currently MHG only has Standin in ACPT
		TRAFFIC Server:
		//Example for ACPT
		svn co https://cptlsvn01/repos/TRAFFIC
		cd TRAFFIC/conf/cptlagw90.za.mhgad.com/Mhg
		vim config.xml
		//duplicate the AMED "env" element
		//change the new "env" element to the name and mhgAccount you need 
		//(using different values for these is possible but is not advised).
		//for the cobol "pool" element change the DEV port to the port 
		//obtained from the LINUX IT-Infrastructure team (contact djason/afranks/rknoesen) 
		//allocated to the new scheme. The host will remain cptlapp80 which is DEV COBOL.
		//save the file
		cd ../../../..
		cd TRAFFIC/conf
		vim cobol_app_server_list.txt
		//add the app server port to the development group:
		//Note the fields are a single space separated
		//DEVELOPMENT <SCHEME/ACCOUNT NAME> cptlapp80.za.mhgad.com <SCHEME/ACCOUNT PORT>
		//save the file
		//commit configuration changes
		cd ../
		svn ci -m "Added scheme <SCHEME NAME> to Mhg Traffic"
		Sweeper:
		ssh cptlagw90
		vim /opt/mhg/NewmedAI/sinsweep.xml
		//duplicate the last job element
		//alter the description to match the new scheme
		//alter the "job-id" element value sequentially
		//in the "11 Sync Stop Commands , | server,port,command" and "10 Sync start Commands | server,port,command" 
		//elements alter the ENV tag value in the command to match the env name configured for the DHS traffic server [2.a]
		//in the "12 claim destination" element alter the value to match the env name configured for the DHS traffic server [2.a]
